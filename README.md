**Inferring password attributes based on smartphone motion sensors**

*Internet of Things 2021 - University of Oulu*

This project was created as part of the Internet of Things 2021 course at the University of Oulu. 
As part of this project, a proof of concept was developed to show that freely accessible motion sensors built into smartphones, 
such as the gyroscope and accelerometer, can reveal sensitive information about passwords. 
Here, it is shown that corresponding patterns emerge within the sensor data when corresponding buttons are tapped. 
In particular, it is shown here that the number of keys entered can be derived. Furthermore, 
it may also be possible to determine whether an entered key is located on the left or right side of a keyboard.

This repository provides a very simple smartphone app that collects and prepares sensor readings from the accelerometer and the gyroscope.
